# Big-Data-Processing
This repository contains interactive Python notebooks covering key topics in Large-Scale Data Processing, including string operations, data structures, file handling, and more. Each notebook provides hands-on exercises for effective learning.

## **Repository Content**

Each notebook covers a specific topic, providing theoretical explanations, practical examples, and exercises to reinforce learning. Below is an overview of the available topics:

### ðŸ”¹ **Python Fundamentals**
- **Strings in Python**: String manipulation, indexing, slicing, concatenation, built-in methods, and searching & replacing substrings. 
- **Lists in Python**: Creation, manipulation, indexing, slicing, copying, and advanced list operations.
- **Sets in Python**: Usage of `set`, logical operations, and set comparisons.
- **Dictionaries in Python**: Creation, access, modification, and manipulation of dictionaries.
- **Conditional Statements in Python**: Use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, along with logical operators.
- **Loops in Python**: Implementation of `for` and `while` loops for data iteration.
- **Functions in Python**: Function definition, parameters, default values, and global variables.

### ðŸ”¹ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Classes and Objects in Python**: Creating classes, instances, attributes, methods, and their application in data modeling.

### ðŸ”¹ **Exercises and Assessments**
- **Practice Exams**: Each topic includes a set of questions with detailed solutions to reinforce understanding and application of the concepts learned.

## **Requirements**
To run the notebooks, you need to install the following tools:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or Google Colab
- **Required libraries**: `matplotlib` (for visualization in some exercises)
